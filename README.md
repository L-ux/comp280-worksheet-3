## I have added the "UI Stuff" unity project from my UI specialism...
... as the shader I made for that ended up being of higher quality. The project shows off the shader perfectly, press play and look around /down. My inital graphics attempt is still included ( Shader Language 3D shield ), and I am still happy with the outcome of it.

### I had many problems to get this working ( Shader Language 3D shield ) ( Problem should be solved now )
The main problem which made everything tolerable, was solved by setting the Scriptable Render Pipeline Setting to None

Edit >> Project Settings >> Graphics >> Scriptable Render Pipeline Setting

If that doesn't work, uh oh
